# collegeAttendance
This website was created for a group of romanian people, so it is presented in romanian.

The purpose of this website was to collect the antendence of a college class during a semester.

The students were able to mark their attendance only during the class, on the page where the app was hosted.
The stundents had access to their attendance, while the professor had access to all the student's attendance.
When the semester came to an end, the professor was able to see all the students that attended his class.

This web app is no longer hosted online.
